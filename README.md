## Hi there 👋

I'm Nolan Xu, a student at NYU 29' majoring in Data Science. 
- I'm familiar with Python, C++, JavaScript, HTML, LaTex, Markdown. (Yeap, really familiar with markdown+ LaTex, taking really notes in this way.)
- I'm an amateur Quant Trading stategy researcher & analyst (purely out of curiosity & and indeed made something, but anyway don't expect too much on me Lmao), you can see the progress as following: (Not open-sourced on Github)
  * Mainstream Trading Styles research
  * Quant Trading Strategy mainly focusing on Micro-cap stocks
  * Hedging strategy respectively for IF and IH
  * Micro-cap stock earthquake (2024/01/15-2024/02/07) research
- I'm a technology devotee with passion for data processing, innovating what on earth can be done with the help of LLM, practical computer science skills (like Git: git push --force haha..)
  * I once downloaded full A-stock data from akshare and established super SQL table and database with data-cleaning mechanism and timely update.
  * I innovated and initiated lots of interesting github repositories as follows:
    * [personal_homepage](https://github.com/Nolan180940/Nolan180940.github.io), It's delicately made, Please visit if possible.
    * [markdown-to-docx_converter](https://github.com/Nolan180940/md-to-word), see README.md in that repository. (thank you streamlit.io)
    * [blog](https://github.com/Nolan180940/blog), a completed full-stack development process demonstrated, using Gemini 3 pro for front end (poorly designed) and Supabase for cloud database as a backend
    * [convenient_online_notebook](https://github.com/Nolan180940/Notebook), ready for immediate use, and support exporting to any format.
    * [cloud_drive](https://github.com/Nolan180940/my-cloud), based on github itself as a backend
  * I forked some from other's repository: (and here express my best gratitude)
    * [chatbot](https://github.com/Nolan180940/llm-examples)
  > Basically, as for those technique experts, you might regard all of them above as really stupid, however, it's a really audacious try from a freshman student. (Please give me some applause and encouragement!)
- I hold firm belief that future will belong to the industry with multidisciplinary traits. AI+ is what I'm commited to. (but don't say I'm a vibe coding wacko...)
- I'd love to devote to a field for an infinite time cause you have to get ready for this and expect for nothing, but anyway as long as you don't feel regretted, that's the best and the wisest choice. I belief life is an endless journey where you're guided with infinite exploration.
